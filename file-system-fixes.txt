There are several bugs and issues with the file system, for one the FAT is busted, it can be fixed somewhat simply enough,
but there will also be memory issues and there are several compiler warnings, start by fixing complier warnings

initialising a char* with an unsigned char array for some reason, the fat is a char * should be a u_char*?
So i'm using a lot of chars, what for. I think if Its for FAT stuff I should use u_int8t, need to check what I'm doing

basically don't use u_char, but where do I do this and what do I use instead, maybe a u_int8t? Or just an unsigned char, the FAT shows us 
where the next block in use by a file is stored, so doesn't need to use characters just numbers, should use u_int8t

Note - the fs.h file is fucked in terms of values, redo them at some point

so the FAT needs a major overhaul, for one thing indexes 0 and 255 are reserved, can make next free index 0 when there isn't one instead of -1
also there is a lot of usage of '0' etc, need to replace that with actual 0, the index 0 is reserved so will always just have 0, the index 255 
will also be reserved so should always also have 0, the rest can have 0, 255, or any value in between

next free slot was set to -1 originally, this is now the chain end value since this is the index of a reserved block, can check that next free index < last index

removed the warnings, though strange errors still happening, for some reason the first block is never free, it's -1 somehow????? that shouldn't be possible anymore so
will need to see why, also so many memory leaks to fix

tracked the -1 issue down to the while loop in load_FAT when it's being mounted, 1 seems to become 255 (255 now, think issue with the -1 was that I hadn't deleted the file 
or recomplied properly)

so it happens after the read, god is dead and C sits atop his corpse

can't read the file through VSC so need to see what it's writing before it mounts it 

OOOH I SEE 

because i'm not skipping the first byte I'm reading the value I stored there that's why it's getting confused,
(found this when checking the values of index 0 and 255 in the FAT and seeing that loading those makes it work fine)

I need to load the whole table but make it not use the first and last 

should be fixed now

okay there are so many memory errors that need fixed but can do that tomorrow
